Which standards tool did you use?

Google Lighthouse on the Chrome Browser.



Name any ONE TEST that passed, and describe why that test is important, in your own words.
What would be the problem if the test had failed?

Passed TEST: Avoids requesting the geolocation permission on page load.

This is important, as users are sometimes mistrustful or confused by sites that request their
location without context, so tying the request to a user action gives the user control over
their privacy.

If the test failed, it may have turned the user away from wanting to use certain features
of the website requiring geolocation tracking, and can potentially have the website operator
liable to legal consequences, since geolocation data would be taken without user consent.



Name any ONE TEST that failed (yellow or red) and explain why the failed test suggest
there's a problem with the website.  Who is it a problem for?  What kinds of obstacles
could this issue present?

Failed TEST: Avoid an excessive DOM size - 1,703 elements. A large DOM will increase memory usage, cause
longer style calculations, and produce costly layout reflows.

This is a problem for every user type, since a large DOM tree can slow down page performance in multiple
ways, including: network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance, and memory performance.
This issue can force users to wait an amount of time proportional to the depth of the DOM tree; larger
the DOM tree, the more time a user will have to wait for a page or element to be loaded on the webpage.
