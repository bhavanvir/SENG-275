# SENG-275

## Course Overview
This course is a practical introduction to testing in a modern software development environment.
The purpose of the course is to give you working knowledge of testing and software development practices so you are prepared for “real world” software testing.
Through a combination of labs, assignments, and practical exercises, you will gain experience applying testing techniques to a non-trivial software product.

## Topics
    1. Testing Techniques:
        • Specification-based testing
        • Boundary Testing
        • Structural Testing (and Measuring Coverage)
        • Design-by-Contracts
        • Property-based Testing
    2. Pragmatic Software Testing:
        • The Testing Pyramid
        • Unit Testing Frameworks
        • Test-Driven Development ("Test-First") and Refactoring
        • Mock Objects and Test Doubles
        • Design for Testability
        • Test Code Quality and Engineering
    3. Test Organization and Environment
        • Developer Testing Workflow
        • Principles of Software Testing and Test Properties
        • Software Defect Tracking
        • Agile and DevOps(Jira)
    4. Testing in Context (and Non-Functional Testing)
        • Web Testing using Selenium scripts
        • Load Testing using ApacheJMeter
        • Database Testing
        • Mobile Testing
        • Security Testing
